# Kubernetes (K8)

## What is Kubernetes?
- Open source container orshestration tool
- Helps to manage containerised applications
- Can be used in phusical, virtual or cloud environments

## Why should we learn it?
- It improves productivity for the entire DevOps team
- It is open source, free, and future-proof
- It makes scaling up and down easy 
- It offers a variety of deployment options and patterns
- Festest-growing product software (after Linux)
- In-demand skill

## Who is using it?
Many companies are using Kubernetes. Some of them include:

- Airbnb
- Capital One
- eBay
- Goldman Sachs
- IBM
- Lyft
- New York Times
- Reddit
- Shopify
- Spotify

## What are the benefits to business?
- Cost savings for container orchestration
- Increased DevOps efficiency for microservices architecture
- Fast deliveries because of easy portability and scalability
- Kubernetes has a large ecosystem of complementary software projects and tools that make it easy to extend its functionality

## What are K8 objects?

Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system . Kubernetes uses these objects to represent the state of your cluster . Specifically, they can describe:

- What containerised applications are running (and on which nodes)
- The resources available to those applications
- The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance 

## Pods
- Pods abstract from containers
- Have their own IP address
- New IP address assigned upon relaunch

## Services
- Permanent IP address for each pod


[*Research  Deployment/s - replica sets - concept of labels and selectors in K8*]

# Deployment with K8
Make sure Kubernetes is installed. Run `kubectl` to get a list of K8 commands.

## Deploying Nginx
Ensure nginx image is running.

Create nginx-k8.yml file using `nano nginx-k8.yml`.

```
# YAML is case sensitive - indentation of YAML is important
# use spaces, not tab
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment
kind: Deployment # pod - service what kind of service/object you want to create
# What would you like to call it - name the service/object
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment # naming the deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # look for this label to match with k8 service
  # Let's create a replica set of this with instances/pods
  replicas: 3 # 3 pods
  # template to use its label for k8 service to launch in the browser
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx # This label connects to the service or any other k8 components
    # Let's define the container spec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: ddoxton/tech241-nginx:latest # Use the image that I built
        ports:
        - containerPort: 100
```

**Make sure it's the same port nginx is running on**.

To run this script:

```
kubectl create -f nginx-k8.yml
```

To make sure it's deployed:

```
kubectl get deployment
```

To check the pods:

```
kubectl get pods
```

## Troubleshooting
- `docker login`
- `docker run -d -p 97:80 ddoxton/tech241-nginx`
- Make sure the repo names match - ddoxton, not ddockers
- Use `kubectl get pods` to get pod names, and use `kubectl describe pod <name of pod>` to get description of potential errors
- If the image wasn't running at first, the k8 deployment needs to be deleted before re-creating. `kubectl delete deployment <name of deployment>`

## Deploying Node App
Ensure node app is running.

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ddoxton/tech241-node-app
```

While in app folder, `nano node-k8.yml`.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment
kind: Deployment # pod - service what kind of service/object you want to create
# What would you like to call it - name the service/object
metadata:
  name: node # naming the deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node # look for this label to match with k8 service
  # Let's create a replica set of this with instances/pods
  replicas: 3 # 3 pods
  # template to use its label for k8 service to launch in the browser
  template: 
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node # This label connects to the service or any other k8 components
    # Let's define the container spec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node
        image: ddoxton/tech241-node-app:latest # Use the image that I built
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```
Create the deployment.
```
kubectl create -f node-k8.yml
```
```
kubectl get deployment
```

## K8 Cluster Architecture

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/qL9XytZ.png)

There is already a deployment with three pods running.

Running `kubectl delete pod <name of pod> will delete a pod. We can create a service where the auto scaling group will create another pod in the same K8 cluster if a pod goes down.

With K8, there is alreay a load balancer and ASG that we didn't need to create. In K8 architecture, it automatically creates a new instance in the same replica set and same deployment.

## Creating a Microservice to expose ports

Create a new file called nginx-service.yml in the same location as the deployment file (nginx-k8.yml).

```
---
# Select the type of API version and type of service/object
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
# Metadata for name
metadata:
  name: nginx-svc
  namespace: default #sre

# Specification to include ports selector to connect to the deployment
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30001
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80

# Let's define the selector and label to connect to nginx deployment
  selector:
    app: nginx # this label connects this service to the deployment

# Creating NodePort type of deployment
  type: NodePort
  ```

Run this service using `kubectl create -f nginx-service.yml`.

The service is now deployed at localhost:30001.

## Mondodb Deployment

A MongoDB image has been created and saved in a container. The container has been pushed to ddoxton/tech241-mongodb repo.

Go into the container using `docker exec -it <container id> sh`. Run `apt update`, `apt install nano` and `apt install sudo`.

Navigate to `/etc/` and open `mongod.conf.orig` and change the bindIP to 0.0.0.0.

Exit the container and commit and push the chandes to the Docker repo.

Create mongo-k8.yml.

```
---

apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment
kind: Deployment # pod - service what kind of service/object you want to create
# What would you like to call it - name the service/object
metadata:
  name: mongo # naming the deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongo # look for this label to match with k8 service
  # Let's create a replica set of this with instances/pods
  replicas: 3 # 3 pods
  # template to use its label for k8 service to launch in the browser
  template: 
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongo # This label connects to the service or any other k8 components
    # Let's define the container spec
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongo
        image: ddoxton/tech241-mongodb:latest # Use the image that I built
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
```
Create the deployment using `kubectl create -f mongo-k8.yml`.

## MongoDB Service

Create mongo-service.yml.

```
---
# Select the type of API version and type of service/object
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
# Metadata for name
metadata:
  name: mongo
  namespace: default #sre

# Specification to include ports selector to connect to the deployment
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 
    port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017

# Let's define the selector and label to connect to mongo deployment
  selector:
    app: mongo # this label connects this service to the deployment

# Creating NodePort type of deployment
  type: NodePort
```

Run `kubectl create -f mongo-service.yml`.

Run `kubectl get service` to ensure it's running.

# Volumes

Data persistence isn't standard with K8, so any changes made to the database will be gone upon pod restart.

The cluster requires storage that:
1. Doesn't depend on the pod lifecycle
2. Is available on all nodes
3. Survives if the cluster crashes

If a change needs to be made after deployment, there is an option to edit instead of deleting the old deployment to create a new one.

Running `kubectl edit deploy <name of deployment>` opens a Notepad text editor where you can edit the deployment.

![Persistent volume architecture](https://i.imgur.com/0XMvLCz.png)

A **Persistent volume** is a cluster resource used to store data. This can be defined in the YAML file.

The storage needs to come from either the local disk or cloud storage, and it needs to be made available to the cluster.

Persistent volumes are not namespaced. They are available to the whole cluster. However, the persistent volume claim must be in the same namespace as the pod.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/XEpi6Sq.png)

- The pod requests the volume through the persistent volume claim
- The PVC trues to find the required volume in the cluster
